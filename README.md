# Introduction
This data repository includes large-scale performance data on Alibaba Cloud, HUAWEI Cloud, Tencent Cloud ans AWS. Since performance varies with different inputs, our data includes multiple combinations of applications and inputs. We use workload to describe an application and its input. The workloads are extracted from HiBench and BigDataBench.
